XMLNews::Meta, version 0.1

This distribution contains a Perl module designed to read and write an
XML-based news metadata format defined at

  http://www.xmlnews.org/

Detailed documentation is available in POD format in module itself.

Since the XMLNews-Meta is RDF-based, this module should eventually be
superceded by a general-purpose RDF processor, once one with
acceptable performance and reliability is available.
